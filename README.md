Stern-Gerlach Experiment Calculator
==========================================
## Introduction
A Stern-Gerlach device demonstrates the intrinsic quantum property of atomic-scale systems which is that the spatial orientation of angular momentum is quantized. 

The experiment involves sending a beam of particles through a magnetic field and observing their deflection. Results show that particles possess an intrinsic angular momentum, but unlike the angular momentum of a classically spinning object, the angular momentum of a particle takes only certain quantized values.

In addition to this concept, only one component of a particle's spin can be measured at a time, meaning that taking a measurement of the spin along a particle's Z axis destroys information about the same particle's spin along the X and Y axis.
